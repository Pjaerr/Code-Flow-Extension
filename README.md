## Contributing

This extensions is a work in progress and as of writing this the core functionality is still incomplete and the extension isn't really ready to receive contributions. Once it is in a stable state and the core functionality works as expected, I will write a getting setup guide and create live github issues. Feel free to try and contribute in the mean time, although the code isn't fully documented and may be unfinished/messy in parts.
