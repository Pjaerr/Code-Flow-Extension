## Contributing

This extensions is a work in progress and as of writing this the core functionality is still incomplete and the extension isn't really ready to receive contributions. Once it is in a stable state and the core functionality works as expected, I will write a getting setup guide and create live github issues. Feel free to try and contribute in the mean time, although the code isn't fully documented and may be unfinished/messy in parts.

### Getting Setup

1. Run `npm install`

2. Run `npm run dev` to watch for both Typescript file changes and changes within Grunt (both are required for the extension to function properly)

3. Press f5 within vs code to debug the extension.

_If you want to debug the diagramming aspect of the code without having to launch vs code every time to click Generate Diagram, you can follow the guide in `diagram-testing.md`._
