This folder location should hold code separate from the VS Code API/Extension and it should contain code that will
be doing the "linking" between every data point, it should also not be doing any of the literal diagramming
as that code will be in Output, but will be fed everything it needs to create a diagram from the code in this folder.

EG: Code in the Logic folder should be taking input or outputting anything, and code in the Input folder or Output folder
shouldn't be doing any logic.
